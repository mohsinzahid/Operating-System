		                    <--How to run the program-->

>>Make
run this command to make output files to all problems

now the command to run problem A is
>> output_A.out

and the command to run problem B is
>> output_C.out

these programs takes commands just like ordinary terminal in linux inlcudes writning">"and reading "<" to the files, executing the file placed in current directory or any other directory(by giving the full path) , linux commands eg man (name), ls etc .

Thanks
